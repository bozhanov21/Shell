# Shell

Coding my own shell

## Design Goals

The goal of this project is to implement a Unix-like shell in Go with an emphasis on
correctness, testability, and OS-level behavior. The shell includes a custom command
parser supporting quoting and escaping, execution of external programs with pipes
and redirection, interactive history with persistence, and programmable autocompletion.
